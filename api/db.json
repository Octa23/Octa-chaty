    "I found out for myself that placing favicon in _app.js makes more sense. This file is most likely to exist already for setting up a layout for the pages or something like this. And you can add Head tag literally anywhere (see the docs) Add a theme.colors object to provide colors for your project. By default these colors can be referenced by the color, borderColor, backgroundColor, fill, stroke, styles. We recommend adding a palette that ranges from 50 to 900. Tools like Themera, Smart Swatch, Coolors or Palx are available to generate these palettes."
